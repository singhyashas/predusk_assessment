Generative AI is a class of artificial intelligence models that can create new content, such as text, images, audio, and video. The most prominent architecture in recent years is the Transformer model, introduced by Google in 2017. This architecture is the foundation for most large language models (LLMs) like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) from OpenAI. OpenAI, founded in 2015, released GPT-3 in 2020, which was a significant leap in language understanding and generation. Its successor, GPT-4, further improved upon these capabilities.

Another key player in the AI space is Google. Google's work on the Transformer model was foundational. They have since developed their own family of LLMs, including LaMDA and PaLM. More recently, Google released Gemini, a multimodal model designed to understand and process information from text, code, images, and video seamlessly. Gemini comes in different sizes, such as Ultra, Pro, and Nano, to fit various applications from large-scale data centers to on-device operations.

Cohere, a Canadian startup founded by ex-Google researchers, focuses on providing LLMs and NLP tools for enterprise use cases. They offer powerful models for generation, summarization, and text representation (embeddings). Their rerank model is particularly effective at improving the quality of search results by re-ordering documents based on their relevance to a specific query. This is a critical step in many Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

The hardware running these models is also crucial. NVIDIA is the leader in manufacturing GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) that are essential for training and running large AI models. Their CUDA platform is the industry standard for parallel computing on GPUs, making them a cornerstone of the current AI boom. Without NVIDIA's hardware, the rapid progress in AI would not have been possible.
