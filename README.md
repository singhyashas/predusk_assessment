# Mini RAG: AI Engineer Assessment

This project is a fully functional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Streamlit and LangChain. It ingests a document, stores its content in a hosted vector database, and uses a reranker and an LLM to answer questions based on that document, complete with source citations.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a classic RAG pipeline:

1.  **Ingestion:** A source text document is loaded, split into smaller chunks, and converted into vector embeddings using a Hugging Face model.
2.  **Storage:** The text chunks and their corresponding embeddings are stored in a hosted **Pinecone** vector database.
3.  **Retrieval:** When a user asks a question, the application retrieves the most relevant document chunks from Pinecone based on semantic similarity.
4.  **Reranking:** The retrieved chunks are re-scored for relevance by **Cohere's Rerank** model to improve the quality of the context.
5.  **Generation:** The top-ranked chunks and the user's original question are sent to a **Groq** LLM, which generates a final answer grounded in the provided sources.
